# WordWatch-SpellCheckingAlgorithmsStudy

# Overview
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for a comprehensive comparison study of spell checking algorithms. The study evaluates the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of five different spell checking algorithms: Binary Search Tree (BBST), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Hashmap, Naive, and TrieSC (Trie with Spell Checker).

# Motivation
Spell checking is a critical component in text processing applications such as word processors, search engines, and chat applications. The objective of this study is to compare the performance and effectiveness of various spell checking algorithms in identifying and correcting misspelled words.

# Algorithms Included
The following spell checking algorithms are included in this study:

Binary Search Tree (BBST)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Hashmap

Naive

TrieSC (Trie with Spell Checker)
